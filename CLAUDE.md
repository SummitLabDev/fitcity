Never push code as Claude Code, only push code as the original owner.

When a new feature is planned, the first thing before executing on the plan is to create a new feature branch. 

Before pushing new code to GitHub, it's useful to check if there are any open issues that the new code will fix. If that is the case, we can solve those issues as well by updating the commit to reference the issue. If not, no issues have to be solved.
